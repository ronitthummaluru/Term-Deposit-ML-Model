#Overview


Banks have several streams of revenue which allow them to be profitable while providing basic banking services including deposit accounts and loans.  These banks can make money from a variety of fees and by earning interest income from loans, but one of their largest sources of income stems from term deposits. A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution, where that money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term.  There are various ways banks can sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing. Telephonic marketing has proved to be one of the most effective ways to reach out to people, however, this marketing strategy also incurs major expenses. Telephonic marketing requires huge investments to be made such as hiring large call centers to actually execute the campaigns, and a lot of time and money can be wasted on calling people who have no interest in having a term deposit with the bank. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call and the efficiency can be improved significantly.
